# Angular Project Backend

Utilizing maven autogeneration tools, a java springboot backend, providing graphql endpoints have been created.

To run:

> mvn compile spring-boot:run

This will generate the graphql springboot stuff and start the server. It uses an h2 embedded server, which stored it's
db file in target/db.
